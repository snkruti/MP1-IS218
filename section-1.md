### Git
**Git** is a system that allows programmers to handle version control when dealing with a codebase.
This allows teams of programmers to work on multiple tasks at once while keeping track of all changes made to the codebase.
In a company, this streamlines the programming process and allows for *faster development periods.* 
This improves productivity, and thereby improves competitiveness.
