### Git
**Git** is a system that allows programmers to handle version control when dealing with a codebase.
This allows teams of programmers to work on multiple tasks at once while keeping track of all changes made to the codebase.
In a company, this streamlines the programming process and allows for *faster development periods.* 
This improves productivity, and thereby improves competitiveness.

### Docker
**Docker** is a system that helps *standardize* programming practices, keeps file systems *lightweight,* and keeps file systems *secure.*
Using Docker can increase a companyâ€™s effectiveness as standardization reduces compatibility issues.
Additionally, the lightweight and secure nature of Docker reduces server costs and security worries.

### Automated Testing
**Automated testing** is self-explanatory, it is software testing that is done automatically.
This offers an advantage to companies as in the long-run it can save *time, manpower, and risk of human error* when testing new features for software.

### Continuous Integration
**Continuous integration** is a practice where programmers integrate their new code frequently into the main repository.
This can help the productivity of companies as it means teams of programmers will be able to *catch and fix errors and conflicts* earlier, rather than later.
